Please note that I was unable to access the full content of the articles or their images due to limitations with the browsing tool. The tool consistently returned "Not able to browse the provided url. Please use the url in the search results" when attempting to access live websites directly, and using the `vertexaisearch` URLs only provided the search result snippets, not the full web page content.

Therefore, the `image` and `content` fields in the JSON are empty. I have provided 33 articles, but I was unable to reach the target of at least 50 with full content. The descriptions are either directly from the search snippets or inferred from the article titles where a description was not explicitly provided in the snippet. The `published_at` dates are based on the information available in the snippets; where a precise date was not given, "May 2025" is used to indicate recent publication.
