    "content": "South Africa's diplomatic decline stems from the same root as the collapse of municipal governance, the economy-choking failings in our logistics network and the gravely inadequate education system, writes Terence Corrigan in his right of reply to Ziyad Motala. It's hard to know where to start in responding to Ziyad Motala's critique of my article on South Africa's foreign projection. Amid the tenuous assumptions, association fallacies, and misrepresentations - not to mention ascribing an entire worldview and motivations to me - I'm afraid his lengthy reply rather misses the points I was trying to make. It's a case of responding without engaging. Since Professor Motala evidently failed to understand my article, let me provide some cheat notes: contrary to much of the public commentary on the issue, the impasse in US-SA relations is not solely attributable to President Donald Trump; South Africa has for years been pursuing a foreign policy that has placed it at odds with the US, and it has been doing so without the diplomatic skill to manage or contain the fallout. No one is arguing for the dilution of South Africa's sovereignty. That is an emotive red herring. South Africa has the right to make whatever choices its duly elected government decides on. That South Africa and the US have differing interests is self-evident. That their positions may be in conflict is hardly surprising. Ideology and geopolitical outlook are important factors here - this is a recognition of reality, not a normative judgement. This is the invariable and inevitable condition of state-to-state relations. The point of diplomacy is managing these conflicts as one element among several and maintaining the benefits of a relationship despite them. This, then, was South Africa's challenge: how to position itself as an essentially hostile power to the US (for that was how the ANC saw it) while simultaneously keeping intact the crucial economic relationship and access to development support, not least the Pepfar programme. The South African state took a multiplicity of high-profile stances against the US, paired with even more aggressive denunciations from the ANC (constitutional strictures aside, the party has done much to erase the party-state distinction, and probably nowhere more so than in the foreign affairs realm). At times, such as the not-yet-resolved matter of renaming Sandton Drive to Leila Khaled Drive, a measure first proposed in 2018 - so predating the current round of contretemps - this was pure bombast, explicitly intended to offend the US. This goes back a long way. Call this “megaphone diplomacy”. This articulation, with which Professor Motala takes issue, is not mine. It's an image used by Ambassador Rasool and by President Ramaphosa's spokesperson. Nothing in what Motala writes disputes this. He is robustly antagonistic to the US, and warmly supportive of the positions South Africa has adopted. If his piece was intended as a justification of South Africa's positions, it might have some merit. But that wasn't my point. SA's de facto alignments and sympathies Nor, incidentally, did I “argue that South Africa should speak clearly and consistently about human rights abuses across the globe”. That might be ideal, but that argument would be pointless, and misunderstand South Africa's foreign projection as it exists, and why it acts as it does. It will not pressure Cuba or China on such matters, and it would be naive to expect it. It's a question of South Africa's de facto alignments and sympathies, and analysts and commentators should understand that South Africa's claims to moral principle are selective. (To which, I have argued elsewhere, South Africa can at least offer a justification of sorts by pointing to the universality of hypocrisy.) While Professor Motala doesn't appear overly concerned about the consequences of all this, whether political or economic, a great many South Africans are. Even Cosatu - whose own views on global politics probably align closely with the professor's - has been worried about the loss of US market access. This is why it's important to understand what has failed from South Africa's side. It developed very little in the way of countervailing vectors of influence. That, by the way, was why I mentioned the Lady R affair. Contrary to Professor Motala's allusions, I made no comment supporting the allegations of arms being loaded on the vessel. (Perhaps he only skim-read my piece and was riffing on a keyword; who knows?) What I did say was that when the allegations were being made, the inadequacies of the South African diplomatic presence in Washington were laid bare: a politically appointed ambassador who had been on long-term sick leave, and a very scant presence of the embassy on circuits where influence is to be generated. It's for times and instances like this that a well-functioning diplomatic service is needed. Likewise, I made no judgement on the draft legislation at the time demanding that the US reexamine its relationship with South Africa, except to say that this was a very grave development, which both exposed the state of South African diplomacy (how had it come to this…) and its ongoing weaknesses, since little enough was done to try to rescue things at that stage. Nor is this something unique to South Africa's relationship with the US, as official evaluations and recent media reports on diplomatic missions elsewhere have noted. SA's diplomatic decline South Africa's diplomatic decline stems from the same root as the collapse of municipal governance, the economy-choking failings in our logistics network, and the gravely inadequate education system. It's expressed for all of us in a growth rate that scrapes by at around 1% a year, and a fixed investment rate of around 15% of GDP - less than half of what its middle-income peers manage. Predictably, Professor Motala also attacks the Institute of Race Relations. Well, he's not the first and won't be the last. Our position on South Africa's malaise is well known and our proposed solutions have been extensively explained. We have pushed for solutions based on non-racialism, economic growth, freedom and prosperity. We need not expand on this here, save to comment that we do indeed seek extensive policy reorientations. The current direction has, after all, hardly been a winner, either at home or abroad. Terence Corrigan is projects and publications manager at the Institute of Race Relations."

    "content": "Build One South Africa leader Mmusi Maimane wants National Assembly Speaker Thoko Didiza to instruct President Cyril Ramaphosa to submit a written reply to the question he passed about Starlink and relaxation of black economic empowerment in ICT sector codes. This comes after Ramaphosa skirted around Maimane's question when he was responding during a question and answer session on Tuesday. Maimane asked whether the exemption or relaxation of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment regulations, which would allow Starlink to operate in South Africa, would apply equally to South African-owned companies. When Maimane raised his concern that Ramaphosa did not answer the substance of his question, Deputy Speaker Annelie Lotriet stated that it was his prerogative to answer as he saw fit. “You can write to the president if you have further clarity,” Lotriet said. EFF leader Julius Malema told Lotriet that she could not say the president has a right and a prerogative to answer the way he liked. “You can't answer for the president. The president must decide whether he has answered or he thinks he can do much better,” he said. However, Malema and Lotriet got into an argument over the exact parliamentary rule on the matter of prerogative of the president and the response to the satisfaction of a member. This resulted in Malema's removal from the virtual platform. On Wednesday, Maimane said Ramaphosa avoided the substance of the question entirely, and instead offered a general commentary on redress that failed to address the core issue of equal treatment and economic fairness for South African businesses. “We are of the view this constitutes a direct contravention of the Executive's constitutional responsibility to account to Parliament.” Maimane also said if an MP can be ruled out of order for asking questions that stray from the original topic, then the president, too, must be held to the same standard. “A response must relate to the question posed. Otherwise, accountability is reduced to a performance, and not a meaningful democratic exercise.” He said the request to Didiza was that she should instruct Ramaphosa to submit a written reply to his question within two days. Maimane also said his request was aimed to “uphold the principle of executive accountability and ensure that the president does not set a dangerous precedent of evasive non-answers in future sittings”. He added that South Africans deserved clarity on whether government policy was being applied fairly and consistently, or whether multinational corporations are being favoured over local businesses. Meanwhile, when asked at the symposium in Cape Town on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said the issue of Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX owned by billionaire Elon Musk, never even came up in the discussions with US President Donald Trump last week despite being there as part of the US delegation. He said the process of having low-orbit satellites providing Wi-Fi and internet connectivity is known in South Africa. “We have been through that, and there are quite a number of other companies, Chinese companies, European companies, Russian companies, and many others, and local companies who are interested in getting into that space. “People tend to focus on one company only, and yet we've got a plethora of companies that would want to get into this space. So the environment to enhance or enable investment to happen in that space is precisely what needs to be properly crafted, properly enacted to enable that to happen.” Ramaphosa said Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Solly Malatsi, who has proposed policy directives on relaxing the black economic empowerment in the ICT sector, has unleashed a process that was going to elicit a lot of comment from the public, from various key stakeholders, including current role-players in the sector. “That in itself is going to exhibit the true democratic process in our country, that when something new, something that is topical or even desirable, has to be flighted or implemented or initiated, it's got to be supported by a lot of discussion, by role-players, even by ordinary people.”"

    "description": "Eskort's CEO warns of a significant food security crisis in South Africa due to the government's ban on chicken imports from Brazil, enacted on May 15, citing an avian flu outbreak. The ban threatens low-cost meal availability and industry production.",
    "image": "",
    "publisher": "IOL",
    "published_at": "2025-05-28",
    "content": "SOUTH Africa stands on the precipice of a significant food security crisis following the government's decision to ban chicken imports from Brazil. This ban, enacted by the Department of Agriculture on 15 May due to an avian flu outbreak in Brazil's Rio Grande Do Sul state, has raised urgent alarms within the local meat industry. Arnold Prinsloo, CEO of meat producer Eskort, has expressed grave concerns over the ban's implications for the country's most vulnerable populations, highlighting that production lines may halt by the end of June if the restrictions are not reversed. “This will deprive South Africa's most vulnerable citizens of more than 400 million low-cost meals per month,” Prinsloo warned during a press briefing. He emphasised that many families and numerous school feeding schemes rely heavily on processed chicken products such as polony, Viennas, Russians, and Braaiwors. The looming halt in production poses a serious risk of widespread hunger and malnutrition, especially among low-income households. Prinsloo has called for the Department of Agriculture to adopt a more tailored approach, akin to that of neighbouring countries like Namibia and Mozambique, which have managed their import bans more cautiously. He advocates for a regionalised ban that focuses solely on the affected state, allowing imports from the rest of Brazil. “A pragmatic and proactive decision to accept imports from unaffected regions will go a long way to heading off the looming crisis in South Africa,” he stated. Echoing these sentiments, industry bodies, including the Association of Meat Importers and Exporters and the South African Meat Processors Association, have urged the government to align with World Organisation for Animal Health protocols, which would facilitate continued trade from unaffected areas. Countries such as Japan and Saudi Arabia have successfully implemented zoning strategies, allowing them to import poultry while shielding public health. The economic repercussions are profound. South Africa imports around 19,000 tonnes of mechanically deboned chicken from Brazil monthly. This quantity is essential for producing a staggering 404 million low-cost meals each month when mixed with other ingredients, according to Prinsloo. The projected 4- to 6-week gap in supply may see production facilities idle, leading to potential job losses and destabilising the lower living standards market, creating a recipe for socio-economic upheaval. Critics within the local poultry industry have claimed they can fill the gap in supply. However, Prinsloo counters these assertions by stating that while there may be capacity for fresh or frozen chicken, local producers fail to meet the essential need for mechanically deboned chicken, a product for which South Africa relies on Brazil for 92%. “This is why the situation is extremely serious,” he added. Finally, Eskort touts its rigorous production processes as ensuring the safety of its products amid health concerns related to avian flu. By heating mechanically deboned meat to temperatures exceeding 70°C, they produce safe, consumable products, a practice that has been integral to their 108-year history without any food safety issues."

    "description": "An analysis of South African politics suggesting a shift in voter priorities from race-related issues to unemployment and job creation, with implications for future political campaigns and party strategies.",
    "image": "",
    "publisher": "Daily Maverick",
    "published_at": "2025-05-21",
    "content": "Since we became a democracy, the issue of race has overshadowed our political narrative and our elections. It has been the dominant axis of our politics. There may now be some evidence that this is changing, and that the party that can literally change the axis, to change the subject, could grab the initiative. It is well known in politics that when planning a campaign, a party will want to choose the ground on which the campaign is fought. If you can determine what the main argument will be, if you can control the ground, you often win. Because of our history and the racialised inequality which still largely defines our society, race has obviously been the major issue. Even parties that would lose out because of this, such as the DA, have accepted this. In previous elections, the DA has sometimes simply elected to provoke a discussion about race on the grounds that if it cannot control the subject, it could at least control the timing. Read more: DA's flag flambé: A horrible no-good ad for horrible no-good times There is some evidence that this may now be changing. This week, the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) released more data from a poll conducted during March (the poll saw 807 respondents comprising a diverse cross-section using Computer Assisted Telephonic Interviews). While some of the headlines on it, such as the claim that “most” people prefer appointments on merit rather than race, will be hugely contested, other findings are less controversial. Unemployment, job creation Among the more interesting findings is that nearly 30% of voters believe that “unemployment and creating jobs” should be the main priority of government. This is far higher than “illegal immigration” or even “crime and security”, which are seen as the main priority by less than 10% of respondents. While seeking an objective view of “what is the most important issue” facing a country is probably impossible, it is true that in most democracies, the economy is the most important political issue. Generally speaking, if an economy is growing quickly, the party in charge will win an election. If an economy is stumbling, it will lose support. Both the last US election and our last election are examples of this, and there are many, many more. Inflation rose during the Biden era (largely because of the pandemic), and our economy has not grown significantly in years. This finding by the IRR follows consistent previous findings and would appear to confirm an old insight in our politics: that if all those who were unemployed voted for one party, that party would dominate our politics. But strangely, despite this apparent truth, not one of our political parties has been able to gain traction with an economic plan. From time to time, some parties have played around with their own version of a “New Deal” that was so effective for President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression. Groups like the DA, Action SA, and even the ANC, from time to time, have claimed to have a plan that would finally move the needle on our economy. And yet, despite the obvious need for it, none has been able to make this the axis of our politics. 'Liberation dividend' wanes Perhaps this might change. As support for the ANC recedes, and as it loses political power as a result, so it loses the ability to control the narrative. Bluntly, the “liberation dividend” for the party has run out. Attempts to talk about the past, to focus on what it did during the struggle, no longer appear to have the power they once did. At the same time, due to its internal contradictions (and the fact that it is so diverse), it has not been able to craft a new message. There is no singular message that it is sending to voters to encourage them to stay with the party. What is less clear is whether this will result in less support for programmes like BEE. While the IRR says this is the case, there are certainly factors that could make it true. It could be that changing attitudes are a function of both the weakening of the race-based narrative and the focus on our past. But it may also be a reaction to perceived corruption relating to deployment, and how so many people appear to have been appointed to jobs without being properly qualified. Even former Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has claimed that cadre deployment is unconstitutional. Failing government services However, this feeling might also be driven by frustration that so many government services are failing. For many voters, the issue may no longer be about who is getting certain jobs, but whether the jobs are being done and the services are working. This plays into what could become another axis in our politics – which party is better able to provide services. The DA has tried to bring this issue to the fore, to make it the ground on which elections are fought, for many years. It is true that on an objective basis, many services appear to work better for many people in the Western Cape. Read more: Head and shoulders above — Cape Town's success could become a key issue in 2024 elections But this is also highly contested; the Western Cape received more money from the apartheid government in the past (for racist reasons), and it does not have any former homelands. The DA's attempts to improve service delivery in other metros where it has governed, such as Tshwane, do not appear to have won significant traction with voters so far. Unpredictable politics It is also entirely possible that other issues come to the fore. Our democracy is nothing if not unpredictable. It is entirely possible, for example, that someone new to politics might capture the public imagination in a way that is currently unimaginable. The fact that there is so much consistent speculation that someone like Patrice Motsepe or Mcebisi Jonas could mount a campaign for the leadership of the ANC shows an appetite for something new. Both in the US and Lesotho, business people with no previous interest in politics have risen to the top job. Read more: Game changer? Difficult but not impossible, Matekane's Lesotho win may show the way to SA's Patrice Motsepe Were someone new to enter our politics in a big way, the new dividing line, the new axis of our politics, could then be whether you support a rich person being President or not. It should also be remembered that while some may wish for issues around race to no longer dominate our politics, our racialised inequality means the issue will always come back. Just as issues around land ownership ebb and flow in our politics, so will race. In the US, many thought the election of Barack Obama in 2008 marked the end of race as a political issue. How wrong they were. It was arguably the single biggest factor behind the election of Trump both in 2016 and last year, and is driving his agenda right now. There is plenty of evidence that our society is changing. But there is no difference between South Africans and anyone else. Everyone wants a better life for themselves and their children. Voters can see that economic growth and job creation are key to this. The opportunity for someone to make this the new axis of our politics may now be opening. But someone will have to grab it and use it effectively."

    "content": "The decision to do away with the VAT increase, without a viable alternative source of revenue, significantly reduced our ability to fund additional government programmes and projects to the extent we had deemed necessary. Nevertheless, this budget supports sustainable finances, the social wage and investments in economic growth. This is not an austerity Budget. It is an expansive Budget. Madam Speaker, a national budget is not merely an accounting exercise measuring what we earn, what we spend and what we borrow as a nation. It is a reflection of the difficult trade-offs needed to balance fiscal sustainability while addressing our developmental goals. It is unsurprising then that the increase to Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed on March 12 created so much debate. A vital debate no doubt, but one that also created some uncertainty. There is clarity now: VAT will remain at 15 per cent. This decision reflects our commitment to listen to South Africans, and to all the political parties represented in this House. Today's budget has taken these views into account. This is what the past two months have provided: valuable lessons that will inform how we manage the budget process moving forward. The reality, however, is that the decision to do away with the VAT increase, without a viable alternative source of revenue, significantly reduced our ability to fund additional government programmes and projects to the extent we had deemed necessary. Nevertheless, this budget supports sustainable finances, the social wage and investments in economic growth. This is not an austerity budget. It increases non-interest expenditure by an average of 5.4 per cent over three years. In real terms, this is 0.8 per cent growth. It is also a redistributive budget. It directs 61 cents of every rand of consolidated, non-interest expenditure towards the social wage. This is money that will be spent to fund free basic services like electricity, water, education, healthcare, affordable housing, as well as social grants for those in need. This budget invests over R1 trillion in critical infrastructure to lift economic growth prospects and improve access to basic services. Madam Speaker, this is done without compromising the fiscal strategy of sustainable public finances. We have achieved this difficult balance by reducing additional spending over the medium term by R68 billion. These reductions are primarily aimed at provisional allocations not yet assigned to votes. Simply put, this means baseline allocations across all spheres of government remain largely unchanged. Instead, the size of the proposed increases to allocations is reduced, in line with what we can afford. Our focus going forward is threefold: balancing the budget through spending efficiencies, strengthening revenue collection, and giving expression to the Medium-Term Development Plan. This undertaking is not insurmountable if we work together, stay focused, and persevere to chart a better course for our economy and our people. Economic outlook Turning to the economic outlook. Madam Speaker, much has changed since our last appearance in this House. The most troubling changes are the global economic developments which have, in the short space of two months, already had a significant impact on the domestic economic outlook. Global The global economy is facing heightened trade tensions and elevated policy uncertainty with worrying economic consequences. The International Monetary Fund now projects global growth at 2.8 per cent in 2025. This is 0.5 percentage points lower than the January estimate. Similarly, global trade is projected at 1.7 per cent in 2025, which is also much lower than the January estimate. At the same time, inflation expectations are now above central bank targets in many advanced and emerging market economies. And new trade barriers may raise inflation and prolong the cycle of higher interest rates. Domestic Turning to the domestic outlook. Madam Speaker, as a small, open economy, South Africa is dependent on global trade and financial inflows. This makes us particularly exposed to the global economic developments that I have just outlined. As a result, we now estimate real GDP to grow at 1.4 per cent in 2025. This is lower than the 1.9 per cent we projected in March. Over the next two years, we project real GDP growth to rise moderately, to 1.6 per cent in 2026 and 1.8 per cent in 2027. Looking further ahead, the risks to the outlook remain elevated. These include the worsening global outlook, weaker-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, the persistence of logistics constraints and higher borrowing costs. These developments are a vivid reminder that we must urgently turn the tide on our economic prospects and get our fiscal affairs in order. Faster, inclusive growth that creates jobs is the only path towards a more prosperous South Africa. Attaining this growth must be our national obsession. We all have a stake and a responsibility to work towards this goal. Fostering faster inclusive growth Honorable members, our strategy for faster growth, and to shield our country from the worst impacts of an increasingly uncertain global environment, remains anchored on four pillars: Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Implementing structural reforms. Improving state capability. Accelerating infrastructure investment. Madame Speaker, let me demonstrate how this budget reflects this strategy. First, maintaining macroeconomic stability promotes low and stable inflation, and lower interest rates while enhancing the country's ability to withstand external shocks. In turn, this creates a conducive environment for investment, savings and job creation. Fiscal strategy Honourable members, prudent fiscal policy is a key component of maintaining macroeconomic stability. The balanced fiscal strategy we are presenting today reflects this. It stabilises debt as a percentage of GDP, achieves a primary surplus, expands infrastructure investment and supports the social wage. In 2025/26, government debt is projected to stabilize at 77.4 per cent of GDP. While this is 1.2 per cent higher than projected in the March 12 budget, it is mainly due to lower nominal GDP. The main budget deficit decreases by R8 billion over the MTEF, compared to our estimates in March. This narrower deficit is enabled by the steadily expanding primary surplus. By 2027/28, the primary surplus will grow from an estimated 0.8 per cent of GDP in this financial year to 2.1 per cent. Madam Speaker, a growing primary surplus means that our revenue will continue to be larger than our non-interest expenditure over the next three years. This contributes to lowering our gross borrowing requirements, resulting in lower debt and lower debt service costs over time. However, debt service costs remain high, amounting to more than R1.3 trillion over the next three years. Put differently, this means in 2025/26 alone we are spending around R1.2 billion per day to service our debt . This is more than what we spend on frontline services such as health, the police and basic education. We must maintain our efforts to reverse this trend, and prevent the cost of debt from robbing us of resources that could otherwise be spent on pressing social needs, or to invest in growth. This fiscal strategy is how we will drive down the debt to GDP ratio, slow the growth in debt service costs and rebuild our fiscal buffers. And in this way shield ourselves from an increasingly uncertain and unpredictable external environment. To address the persistent fiscal imbalances in the medium to long term, we have published a discussion document on fiscal anchors. The consultations with a range of stakeholders and experts on this paper are ongoing. Structural reforms Madam Speaker, a bigger, faster-growing economy, and the larger fiscal resources that come with it, are the key to building up the fiscal room we need to meet more of our developmental goals. The second pillar of the economic growth strategy is in our continued commitment to implement growth enhancing structural reforms. Through the first phase of Operation Vulindlela, bold and far-reaching reforms were implemented in the network sectors and the visa regime. As a result, numerous economic bottlenecks have eased, new investments unlocked, and the growth potential of the economy enabled. Yet the economy still faces constraints. During the launch of the second phase of OV two weeks ago, the President aptly pointed out that, and I quote: “Our economy needs to grow much faster to create jobs that we need and to achieve prosperity for all”. The second phase will therefore focus on the following areas: Seeing-through existing reforms in energy, water, logistics and in the visa regime. Improving the performance of local government. This includes professionalising utilities, appointing suitably qualified people to senior positions, and reviewing the local government fiscal framework. Harnessing digital transformation, in order to drive the adoption of digital technologies in government and build digital public infrastructure for use by all South Africans. Addressing the apartheid legacy of spatial inequality. Reforms will include changes to housing policy and accelerating the release of publicly owned land and buildings. This will also entail clearing the backlog of title deeds for affordable housing, and a comprehensive regulatory review aimed at removing barriers to the development of low-cost housing. Tackling these structural constraints will ensure that impediments to faster growth are removed. Revenue proposals Madam Speaker, the budget process this year has been contentious, mainly due to the tax proposals announced on March 12. I want to assure the public, and this House, that the aim of the March 12 budget was to balance the necessity of growing the economy, with the equally urgent need to repair and rebuild our public finances. This remains our goal. And as I have already said, the proposed increases in the VAT rate in 2025/26 and 2026/27 have been dropped. As a result, the expansion of the zero-rated basket, which was included to cushion poorer households from the VAT rate increase, falls away. Madam Speaker, compared to the March estimates, tax revenue projections have been revised down by R61.9 billion over the three years, This reflects the reversal of VAT increase and the much weaker economic outlook. In this difficult environment, it remains vital that we still take actions to increase revenue to protect and bolster frontline services, while expanding infrastructure investments to drive economic activity. To this end, this budget proposes an inflation-linked increase to the general fuel levy. For the 2025/26 fiscal year, this is the only new tax proposal that I am announcing. This is the first fuel levy increase in three years. It means from the fourth of June this year, the general fuel levy will increase by 16 cents per litre for petrol, and by 15 cents per litre for diesel. Unfortunately, this tax measure alone will not close the fiscal gap over the medium term. The 2026 Budget will therefore need to propose new tax measures, aimed at raising R20 billion. We have allocated an additional R7.5 billion over the MTEF, to increase the effectiveness of the South African Revenue Service in collecting more revenue. Part of this allocation will be used to increase collections from debts owed to the fiscus. SARS has indicated that this could raise between R20 billion to R50 billion in additional revenue per year. Another part of the additional allocation to SARS will be used to improve modernisation. This will include targeting illicit trade in tobacco and other areas, which should boost revenue over the medium term. As SARS utilises this investment to raise additional revenue, which I believe can be at least R35 billion, the R20 billion to close the current revenue gap will not have to be raised through taxes. Madam Speaker, let me call on every South African, be they individuals, small business operators or large corporates, to honour their tax obligations and contribute to building a better and more equitable nation. To all the taxpayers that continue to pay their taxes, thank you. We do not take this for granted. As a government, we know that we must earn the taxpayer's trust every day, by spending public money with care and ensuring that every rand collected is spent on its intended purpose. We recognise the urgent need to do more to achieve this goal. We are not deaf to the public's concern about wasteful and inefficient expenditure. Our commitment to collect taxes must be matched by better efficiency in how that money is spent. It must be matched by much stricter oversight that quickly identifies problems and provides timely solutions when things go wrong. Spending priorities Honourable Speaker, Members of Parliament, and fellow South Africans, before I continue, allow me a moment to share with you an open letter from a young medical student, Sarah Stein from UCT. I have read and reread the letter since it was published on 7 May. The extract of the letter I want to share may be disturbing to some, but perhaps familiar to many of you. Too many. The situation this young doctor describes, of the state of our public hospitals, and the emotional toll of working day after day without the basic resources necessary to help people in need, is the heart breaking reality that this budget hopes to address. It is the reality that all of our efforts, as political parties, and as a government, must be concerned with, above all else. Part of the letter reads: Working in a public hospital with way too few resources punches you in the gut every day. It's not just the trauma of seeing your patient die — it's having no gloves in a delivery room; no alcohol swabs to clean wounds; and knowing that nurses stop at the shop on their way to work to buy their own gloves and masks because the clinic has run out. Where waiting times for a scan are months long and surgery delays needlessly let disease progress to the point of being inoperable. It's the limited beds in high care that mean doctors are regularly forced to decide whose life is worth saving more because there's only space for one. Madam Speaker, it is for this reason that the budget maintains the expenditure trajectory presented in the March 12 budget. Addressing the persistent spending pressures to restore critical frontline services and invest in infrastructure is critical for improving access to basic services and lifting economic prospects. As a result, total allocated spending excluding interest will amount to R6.69 trillion over the medium term. There is also proposed additional spending of R180.1 billion. This is lower than the R232.6 billion proposed during the March 12 budget. A breakdown of the sector allocations is as follows: The provincial education sector baseline over the 2025 MTEF is R1.04 trillion, and R9.5 billion will be added over the medium term to keep teachers in classrooms and hire more staff. An additional R10 billion has been added to the baseline as announced during the March 12 budget to expand access to early education is kept unchanged. This will increase the ECD subsidy from R17 per child per day to R24. The extra funding will also support increased access to ECD for 700,000 more children, up to the age of five years. The provincial health sector budget is R845 billion over the medium term. This budget will be increased by R20.8 billion over three years to employ 800 post-community service doctors and essential goods and services and reduction of accruals. This increase will also assist the sector in addressing personnel budget pressures. From April 2025, the old age grant increased by R120 to R2,310 and is set to increase by an additional R10 to R2,320 in October, as originally announced in March. The COVID-19 social relief of distress will be extended to the end of March 2026. Government is actively exploring various options to better integrate this grant with employment opportunities. This includes considering a job-seeker allowance and other measures, as part of the review of Active Labour Market Programmes. Our goal is to not only provide immediate relief. It is also to create pathways to employment, empowering our citizens to build better futures for themselves and their families. We are also reconfiguring funding for the troop deployment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is in light of the announcement of South Africa's phased withdrawal from the East African country. In this regard, the R5 billion we had proposed to allocate to the Department of Defence for its participation in the SADC mission in the DRC is reduced. But the allocation for 2025/26 has been increased from R1.8 billion to R3 billion. This will cover the immediate costs of an orderly and safe withdrawal of our troops and mission equipment. Madam Speaker, R1.4 billion is allocated to support the preparations for the upcoming local elections. R885 million of the allocation is for the Independent Electoral Commission and R550 million for the South African Police Service and the South African National Defence Force to maintain public order. This investment contributes to upholding the democratic processes and ensuring that every South African can exercise their right to vote in a safe and secure environment. This budget also retains the provisional allocations for early retirement, allocations for PRASA and the municipal trading entity reforms announced before, but at a slightly lower level than anticipated in the March 12 budget. Madam Speaker, the spending choices we are proposing today demonstrate the government's determination to bolster the state capability needed to deliver quality, reliable and sustainable core services. This is what pillar three of the economic growth strategy is about. Despite the additional allocations we have made here, there are other long-standing spending pressures that persist but cannot be funded within the current envelope. This is the nature of policy trade-offs: prioritising what we can do now and what we must postpone and spend on later when our revenue allows. The spending pressures that may require funding later this year, include: The withdrawal of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding, particularly through USAID. Infrastructure projects in the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) rolling stock fleet renewal programme. Accommodating population changes that impact on the provincial equitable share allocations. Strengthening capabilities in the Office of the Chief Justice and Statistics South Africa. Political party funding and infrastructure provision for royal houses. The National Social Dialogue. Spending efficiencies Honourable members, when an economy underperforms, as ours has over the last decade, it generates less tax revenue while requiring increased social spending, widening budget deficits and accelerating debt accumulation. To be successful, our strategy of maintaining fiscal discipline while investing in growth demands that we prioritise high-impact expenditures. These are expenditures that deliver economic returns while eliminating inefficiencies, wastage and leakage that too often plague government's spending. To tackle this, the National Treasury has undertaken expenditure reviews looking at more than R300 billion in government spending since 2013, with the aim of identifying duplications, waste and inefficiencies. We found potential savings of R37.5 billion over time through improved oversight and operational changes through these reviews. Going forward, underperforming programmes will be closed as the 2026 MTEF budget process undergoes redesign. New reforms will target infrastructure planning and implementation across provinces and municipalities. A data-driven approach to detecting payroll irregularities will replace the more costly method of using censuses. This initiative will cross-reference administrative datasets to identify ghost workers and other anomalies across government departments. Part of the goal of these initiatives is to also remove the regulatory burden on business. Madam Speaker, to be successful, not just technical solutions are required. Sustained political backing, at the highest levels, is needed to overcome departmental resistance and to protect whistleblowers who expose irregularities and wastage. I am happy to say that this political backing has already come from President Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy President Pau Mashatile, as well as my Cabinet colleagues. The President has also undertaken to establish a committee between the Presidency and Treasury to identify wasteful, inefficient and underperforming programmes. I call on Ministers, MECs, DGs, HoDs and every official responsible for public funds to embrace these efforts and play their part. Division of revenue Madam Speaker, the division of nationally raised revenue will see R2.4 trillion of total non-interest spending allocated to provinces over the medium term. Municipalities will receive R552.7 billion over the same period. The split addresses the fiscal realities faced by provinces and local governments. The allocations will fund increases in the cost of bulk water and electricity costs provided for free to needy households. In 2025/26, 83 per cent of the local government equitable share provides a free basic services package of R610 per month to 11.2 million poor households. Honourable members, this package of free municipal services continues to be a key tool for reducing poverty and inequality, raising living standards and facilitating access to greater economic opportunities. The reality is that sustainable local government finance does not depend merely on enforcement mechanisms, but on delivering genuine value to communities. Declining revenue collection rates are often a function of the quality of the services. Municipalities must recognise that quality service delivery is not just a constitutional obligation but also the cornerstone of their own financial viability. Fighting corruption Tackling corruption remains a major priority for all arms of government. We are making progress in pushing back against actions that compromise our national interests. In addressing the scourge of corruption, the National Prosecuting Authority has, through its Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) adopted a broader and aggressive anti-corruption strategy that has yielded financial injection to the fiscus. In the past five years the AFU has recovered over R5 billion paid into the victims of crime and Criminal Asset Recovery Account (CARA). With regards to state capture related cases, the AFU obtained freezing orders amounting to R14.2 billion with R8 billion recovered and paid to the CARA. Infrastructure Madam Speaker, quality infrastructure investment expands the productive capacity of the economy and responds to the diverse needs of the citizens. Infrastructure is also a rich source of jobs, in construction, engineering, and related industries across a range of skill levels. It is for these reasons that infrastructure is the fourth pillar of the growth strategy. And this budget demonstrates our resolve to change the composition of spending from consumption to investment. Allocations towards capital payments remain the fastest-growing area of spending by economic classification. Public infrastructure spending over three years will exceed the R1 trillion mark. This spending will focus on maintaining and repairing existing infrastructure, building new infrastructure, and acquiring equipment and machinery. It will focus on three sectors: transport and logistics; energy and water and sanitation. Of the R402 billion for transport and logistics, R93.1 billion is for the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) to keep the 24,000-kilometer national road network in active maintenance and rehabilitation. R53.1 billion is for the maintenance and refurbishment of provincial roads. These investments will maintain our extensive road network in good condition allowing easy access and movement of freight and people within the country and beyond. R66.3 billion is allocated to PRASA, out of which R18.2 billion is for the rolling stock fleet renewal programme and R12.3 billion is provisionally allocated for the renewal of the signaling system. The spending will sustain progress in rebuilding the infrastructure to provide affordable commuter rail services. This will enable PRASA to increase passenger trips from 60 million in 2024/25 to 186 million by the end of the MTEF period. Access to safe, reliable and affordable commuter service is critical for low-income earners who spend more than 50 per cent of their income on transport. The energy sector will invest R219.2 billion on strengthening the electricity supply network, from generation to transmission and distribution. This includes investments in renewable energy projects which continue to contribute to stabilising the power supply resulting in reduced load shedding. Efforts to connect more renewable energy projects to the grid and expand the transmission network through a multi-line transmission package remain on track. The water and sanitation sector will spend R156.3 billion on expanding our water resource and service infrastructure including dams, bulk infrastructure to service mines, factories and farms. Honourable members, maintenance is important to prolong the life of our infrastructure assets, in addition to ensuring that infrastructure services are reliable and not unnecessarily interrupted. This is the reason our budgets emphasise this aspect in addition to building new infrastructure. To further support infrastructure delivery and improve spending efficiency, the National Treasury continues to implement reforms that will facilitate greater private sector participation in public infrastructure. Public-private partnerships The new regulations for public-private partnerships (PPPs) were gazetted earlier this year and will take effect next month. These will reduce the procedural complexity of undertaking PPPs, increasing the deal flow and allowing government to leverage its limited resources to fast-track infrastructure provision. The National Treasury has developed enabling guidelines and frameworks to support the new regulations. Specifically, the unsolicited proposals framework will create clear rules for managing proposals from the private sector. And the framework for fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities will strengthen fiscal risk governance. These guidelines and frameworks will be published in the next few weeks. The recently established private sector participation unit of the Department of Transport and Transnet are making progress in engaging the market on PSP projects. The PSPs will resolve and improve some of the critical logistic bottlenecks in the rail and port networks. In March, a request for information was issued for the ore, chrome, coal and manganese lines. In April, a request for qualification was issued for the establishment of an independent rolling stock leasing company. Budget facility for infrastructure Madam Speaker, the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) has been effective in supporting quality investments. It does so by reviewing proposals for feasibility, viability and cost effectiveness. To date, R52.9 billion in additional funding has been unlocked through this process. To scale up the success, the BFI has been reconfigured to accept proposals quarterly rather than annually. Alternative financing arrangements In this regard, I am pleased to confirm that the process of issuing our first infrastructure bond in 2025/26 remains intact. We are also exploring alternative financing instruments to allow pension funds, commercial banks, development banks and international financial institutions to participate in financing our infrastructure plans. These reforms, Madam Speaker, are how we plan to leverage infrastructure investment to ease supply side constraints to the economy and improve access to social services the people get. Conclusion Honourable members today is about delivering on the hope for a better life and a better future. It is an attempt to meet our shared goals of redistribution, redress and structural transformation. This budget supports economic activity while raising future economic prospects, directs spending towards the social wage, and invests in state capability and critical infrastructure. All the while promoting fiscal sustainability, so future generations are not burdened by the decisions we make today. We are not there yet. But I believe there is consensus in this House and around the country that this is the destination we need to strive for. The recent events have shown us that political debate is part of any vibrant democracy, and that this is not about differences on these goals, but about how they can be achieved. The debate and negotiations have deepened our understanding of policy trade-offs and institutional processes, while giving citizens unprecedented visibility into our democracy's evolution. Negotiation, debate and comprise, as we have seen unfold over the last weeks, has been a necessary, if sometimes painful investment in the productivity of future government reform in the new political environment. We have all gained a better, deeper appreciation of each other's policy positions and which trade offs each of us is willing to contemplate. As parliamentarians, we have been forced to gain closer knowledge of the various institutional processes that govern the budget cycle and its passing into law. The public has had a front-row seat to the growing pains of a vibrant and committed democracy. This is a good thing. Our journey toward national prosperity belongs to every South African. Speaker, as I close, allow me to express my gratitude to the President and Deputy President in absentia for the wisdom of their counsel and the calm of their leadership. Our country is in safe hands! My appreciation also goes to the two Deputy Ministers of Finance and the National Treasury team led by the Director-General. They have helped to share the tremendous workload and as they say, “many hands make light work.” Thank you to the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service and the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank for the care and commitment they have applied to leading these two key institutions. To my Cabinet colleagues, the Ministers' Committee on the Budget, and the Budget Council, thank you for always standing ready to think through the toughest choices and chart a path forward in the interests of the country. Thank you to the Chairperson and Commissioners of the Financial and Fiscal Commission for their valuable input. To the Parliamentary Committees of Finance, Appropriations and Public Accounts, I express my sincere appreciation. To my beloved wife and family, your patience and unwavering support have sustained me through each challenge. Thank you for walking this path with me. Lastly, thank you to South African people who continue to entrust their aspirations to us."

    "image": "",
    "publisher": "IOL",
    "published_at": "2025-05-28",
    "content": "President Cyril Ramaphosa says his government, the Government of National Unity (GNU), has implemented adequate measures to protect low-income South Africans from the rising cost of necessities. This comes as the average household food basket has increased by nearly 40% relative to inflation. Ramaphosa emphasised that the government was fully aware of the financial pressures facing citizens and remains committed to supporting the most vulnerable through targeted relief measures. He was responding to oral questions in Parliament, Cape Town on Tuesday. “Government recognises the high cost of living facing South Africans. “Tackling poverty and the cost of living is one of the three strategic priorities of the GNU and forms a central pillar of the Medium TermDevelopment Plan. “South Africa's macroeconomic policy framework has been a key lever for shielding the poor from the high cost of living,” he said. Ramaphosa mentioned that the framework included an inflation target, which has helped to keep prices low and stable and has been important in reducing average prices. “Food price inflation has fallen quite significantly from 12.7 percent at the end of 2022 to 2.2 percent in March 2025. “Headline inflation, which is a measure of the general cost of living, has also declined, averaging 4.4 percent in 2024 and inflation has even moderated further to 2.7 percent in March 2025,” he said. “Food staples, such as maize meal, brown bread, rice, samp, milk, eggs, and other basic foodstuffs remain exempt from VAT, to help to cushion lower-income households in our country. “Our fiscal policy has been redistributive, prioritising poor and low-income households. The government spends around 60 percent of its revenue on the social wage, which includes spending on social grants on education and health.” Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, presented his 2025 national budget, without Value-Added-Tax (VAT) but social grants were increased at a rate higher than inflation. The provision of free basic services, such as water and electricity, for indigent households is an essential measure in reducing the high cost of living. “This package of free municipal services continues to be a key tool for reducing poverty and inequality, and raising living standards and facilitating access to greater economic opportunities for many of our people."
