    "content": "South Africa has seen another 109 business liquidations in the month of April 2025, taking the total number of closures to 482 for the year so far. According to Stats SA's latest report on liquidations in the country, the finance, insurance, real estate and business services sector continues to be the hardest hit by closures, followed by trade, catering and accommodation. However, the data also shows that closures are easing, with the number of liquidations down from March 2025, and down almost 15% from the same time last year. Closures for the year to date are also 6% lower than the same time in 2024, Stats SA noted. Looking at the longer-term trend, while 2025 s currently showing a small 'bounce' thanks to the number of liquidations earlier in the year, the overall picture is pointing down from the peak in 2021, and a ris in 2022. Another important distinction to make is the difference between voluntary and compulsory liquidications. Compulsory liquidations are often court-ordered and reflective of business failure, while voluntary liquidations are not necessarily the same. Business experts have noted that voluntary liquidations could be indicative of business activity, with subsidiaries or special purpose vehicles being liquidated for investment or development purposes. Most of the liquidations recorded by Stats SA are voluntary liquidations. In April, 98 of the 109 liquidations were voluntary, while only 11 were compulsory. For the first three months of the year, compulsory liquidations were higher than in 2024."

    "description": "The South African Reserve Bank is set to announce its monetary policy decision on May 29, with economists divided on a rate cut, while a US federal court has blocked most of Donald Trump's global tariffs.",

    "content": "The South African rand remained steady on Wednesday, just one day before the central bank's interest rate decision. It was trading at 17.9375 against the U.S. dollar, showing little change from Tuesday's closing level. The US dollar was approximately 0.3% stronger against a basket of currencies as markets awaited the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting and upcoming economic data for clues about the US interest rate outlook. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) will announce its monetary policy decision today at around 13h00 on May 29. On Thursday, 29 May, the rand was trading at R17.95 to the dollar, R24.13 to the pound and R20.19 to the euro. Oil was trading slightly lower at $65.77 a barrel. Here are five other important things happening in and affecting South Africa today: What to expect from interest rates: The majority of economists polled by Reuters and Bloomberg expect the bank to cut its main lending rate by 25 basis points. However, a significant minority, including local economists, think the rate could be left unchanged. Tariffs ruled illegal: The US trade court ruled most of President Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal, undermining a key part of his economic agenda. A three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade unanimously sided with Democratic-led states and small businesses, stating that Trump wrongfully invoked an emergency law to justify his tariffs. 30% electricity price hike a reality: The Electricity Resellers Association of South Africa (ERASA) will determine a response this week to a looming 30% electricity tariff increase affecting end-users in Eskom areas. Recent bills show that a building in eastern Pretoria saw its costs rise from R357,921 to R464,081. Resellers must pass on these costs, despite users expecting only a 12.74% increase approved by Nersa. ERASA argues this average does not reflect larger increases for lower electricity users."

    "description": "A new Cisco report reveals that only 5% of South African organizations are fully prepared for modern cyberattacks, with accelerating AI threats and a critical skills gap posing significant risks to businesses.",

    "publisher": "Mamsi Nkosi",
    "published_at": "2025-05-29",
    "content": "According to Cisco's 2025 Cybersecurity Readiness Index, only 5% of organizations in South Africa are fully prepared to defend against modern attacks. Accelerating AI threats are also leaving most South African businesses vulnerable to attacks as they remain at the formative stage of security readiness, with a critical skills gap compounding the risk. The Index outlines that 87% of local organizations experienced AI-related security incidents in the past year, yet only 59% believe their employees understand AI-driven threats. While AI is being rapidly adopted for threat detection and response, gaps in awareness, oversight of GenAI use, and underinvestment in cybersecurity leave businesses dangerously exposed. Fady Younes, Managing Director of Cybersecurity for Cisco Middle East & Africa, says, “The speed at which AI is being weaponized by threat actors is outpacing traditional security approaches. Globally, we're seeing that fragmented defenses and under-resourced teams can't match the scale or sophistication of today's attacks. Organizations must shift from incremental upgrades to integrated, AI-native strategies that can defend at machine speed; anything less is no longer sustainable.” Findings for South Africa The lack of cybersecurity readiness is alarming, as 22% of respondents anticipate business disruptions from cyber incidents within the next 12 to 24 months. AI's Expanding Role in Cybersecurity: An impressive 92% of organizations use AI to understand threats better, 89% for threat detection, and over 80% for response and recovery, underscoring AI's vital role in strengthening cybersecurity strategies. GenAI Deployment Risks: GenAI tools are widely adopted, with 47% of employees using approved third-party tools. However, 21% have unrestricted access to public GenAI, and 40% of IT teams are unaware of employee interactions with GenAI, underscoring major oversight challenges. Unmanaged Device Vulnerability: Within hybrid work models, 75% of organizations face increased security risks as employees access networks from unmanaged devices, further exacerbated by using unapproved Gen AI tools. Investment priorities are shifting: While 30% of organizations plan to upgrade their IT infrastructure, only 8% allocate more than 10% of their IT budget to cybersecurity. This highlights the need for more focused investment in defense strategies as threats continue to rise. Complex Security Postures: Over 60% of organizations report that their complex security infrastructures, dominated by the deployment of more than ten point security solutions, are impeding their ability to respond swiftly and effectively to threats. Talent Shortage Impedes Progress: A staggering 78% of respondents identify the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals as a major challenge, with more than half reporting more than ten positions to fill. Smangele Nkosi, General Manager at Cisco South Africa, concludes, “To meet today's cybersecurity demands, organizations must prioritize AI-powered solutions, streamline their security architecture, and build greater awareness of AI-driven threats. It's crucial to focus on AI for faster detection, response, and recovery — while also addressing talent shortages and mitigating risks from unmanaged devices and shadow AI.”"

    "content": "Asian shares and Wall Street futures have surged today after a finding by a U.S. federal court blocked President Donald Trump's international import tariffs from going into effect, pushing the dollar up against safe-haven currencies. The little-known Manhattan-based Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from U.S. trade partners on 2 April this year. The White House immediately appealed the decision, and this may well see the case go as far as the Supreme Court. It does provide a little bit more stability in the markets and could result in the level of tariffs having to be reviewed. Meanwhile, US delegations continue to proceed with trade negotiations with multiple countries. All the Asian markets have shown improvements this morning following the decision by the trade court."

This, according to the company, was a strategy to support their financials as a treasury reserve asset. The group had been struggling to maintain growth, with online gaming purchases wiping out a significant portion of their sales. In March this year, GameStop told investors that it was changing its investment policy to add crypto as an asset on the company's books. The establishment of a US Strategic Crypto reserve by the current administration has made cryptocurrency a more stable asset, with several major corporations having added it to their asset listings recently."

    "content": "Brand Africa, in partnership with African Business and the Economic Commission for Africa, this week unveiled the results of the 15th annual Brand Africa 100 | Africa's Best Brands rankings. The 2025 rankings reveal a distinct disconnect between rising African optimism and declining brand loyalty. While 68% of Africans express belief in Africa, up from 64% in 2024, only 11% of the Top 100 most admired brands are African. This marks a historic low point form 14% in 2024. This drop highlights an urgent challenge in Africa with a greater need for homegrown brands to establish their dominance to consumers across diverse markets. Companies need to convert belief into consumer commitment, to provide sufficient brand buy-in from consumers and build generational brand support for “Made-in-Africa brands. The rankings are based on a comprehensive pan-African survey conducted across 31 countries and in 8 languages, from Arabic to Swahili – representing over 85% of the continent's population and GDP. The research reflects a changing brand landscape driven by Africa's youthful population, expanding cultural influence, and growing geopolitical engagement with global blocs such as the G20 and BRICS+. 2025 Brand Africa 100 | Africa's Best Brands – Highlights. Nike retains its #1 position as the most admired brand overall in Africa for the 8th consecutive year, with a relatively unchanged Top 10. MTN and Dangote are the top African brands by spontaneous and aided recall, respectively. MTN is the #1 brand contributing to a better Africa and for doing good for society and the environment. Bathu is the #1 most admired apparel brand. Standard Bank is the most admired financial services brand. Nike leads among Gen Z and Millennials, while Samsung leads for Gen Z and Baby Boomers. Top categories: Technology (18%), Luxury (12%), Consumer Non-Cyclical (11%), Auto-Manufacturers (9%). BBC is the #1 media brand overall; DStv is the #1 African media brand."
