With national debt remaining a significant concern and the need to fund essential public services, the National Treasury is constantly exploring avenues to bolster revenue. While no official announcement has been made, experts from institutions like the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) and various banking groups have highlighted that raising VAT from its current 15% could be considered, especially if other revenue-generating measures or significant expenditure cuts prove insufficient.\n\nSuch a move, however, would be highly contentious. Critics argue that a VAT increase disproportionately affects lower-income households, exacerbating inequality in an already strained economy. Labour unions and civil society organizations typically advocate for alternative solutions, including combating illicit financial flows, improving tax collection efficiency, and stimulating robust economic growth to broaden the tax base. The debate intensifies ahead of key fiscal policy announcements, as the government navigates the delicate balance between financial stability and socio-economic impact.",
