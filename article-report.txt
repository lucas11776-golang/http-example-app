		"title": "Standard Bank Faces Renewed Scrutiny Over Controversial R100 Soweto Home Auction in Decades-Long Legal Battle",
		"content": "The long-running legal saga between Soweto homeowner Mr. Themba Nkau and Standard Bank has once again drawn sharp criticism towards the financial institution after his family home was controversially repossessed and sold at auction for a mere R100 in 2011. The deeply contentious sale stemmed from a property loan initiated in 1992, igniting a three-decade battle for justice.\n\nInitially, Mr. Nkau took out a R45,000 loan from Standard Bank in 1992. Despite arguments that he had settled the debt, his home was auctioned off for a fraction of its value. This shocking development has been a focal point of public outrage and legal scrutiny, with the Supreme Court of Appeal previously referring the matter back to the High Court for further consideration. Critics argue the case highlights systemic issues within the banking sector regarding repossessions and the protection of vulnerable homeowners. Standard Bank has consistently maintained its actions were lawful, but the ongoing litigation underscores the severe impact on families caught in such protracted disputes.",
